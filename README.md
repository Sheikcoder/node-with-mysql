## Description
This project is a Node.js application built using the Sequelize ORM for interacting with a MySQL database. It encompasses a variety of features, including basic CRUD operations, user authentication with Bearer Tokens, Sequelize migrations for database schema management, seeders for populating the database with initial data, image upload capabilities, and advanced SQL operations like table joins. The application also leverages Sequelize associations such as hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, and belongsToMany for establishing relationships between different database tables.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
- **Authentication with Bearer Token**: Implement secure authentication using Bearer Tokens.
- **Sequelize Migrations**: Manage and version-control database schema changes effortlessly.
- **Sequelize Seeders**: Populate the database with predefined data for testing and development.
- **Image Uploads**: Allow users to upload images to the server.
- **Table Counts**: Retrieve and display counts of records in various database tables.
- **Join Tables**: Perform advanced SQL operations by joining tables.
- **Associations**: Establish relationships between tables using Sequelize associations (hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany).

## Setup

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the database: `npm run db:migrate`
4. Seed the database: `npm run db:seed`
5. Start the server: `npm start`
